# animatronic
Created for an engineering project for the NC State First-year Engineering Design Day (FEDD). https://engr.ncsu.edu/academics/undergrad/firstyear/fedd/. This engineering project won second place in the 2023 competition.

Created in conjuction with a team for an animatronic shark. The team worked on the physical shark while I worked on the Arduino wiring and firmware. This is the firmware for controlling the arduino. This code uses the protothreads library for simulating multithreading on an Arduino.
